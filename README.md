# face_recognition
Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem
Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pre-trained model
Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings
